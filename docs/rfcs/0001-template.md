## RFC Metadata

- **RFC ID**: 0001
- **Title**: RFC Template
- **Status**: Template
- **Type**: Template
- **Created**: 2024-01-01
- **Authors**: SpecCursor Team
- **Reviewers**: TBD
- **Supersedes**: None
- **Superseded By**: None

## Summary

This RFC template provides a standardized format for submitting RFCs (Request for Comments) to the SpecCursor project.

## Motivation

RFCs provide a structured way to propose and discuss significant changes to the SpecCursor project. This template ensures consistency and completeness in RFC submissions.

## Detailed Design

### RFC Structure

Each RFC should follow this structure:

1. **RFC Metadata**: Basic information about the RFC
2. **Summary**: Brief overview of the proposed change
3. **Motivation**: Why this change is needed
4. **Detailed Design**: Technical implementation details
5. **Alternatives Considered**: Other approaches that were evaluated
6. **Implementation Plan**: Step-by-step implementation approach
7. **Testing Strategy**: How the change will be tested
8. **Documentation**: Documentation requirements
9. **Migration Guide**: Migration steps for breaking changes
10. **Open Questions**: Unresolved questions or concerns

### RFC Types

- **Feature**: New functionality or capabilities
- **Enhancement**: Improvements to existing functionality
- **Breaking Change**: Changes that break backward compatibility
- **Architecture**: Significant architectural changes
- **Process**: Changes to development or operational processes

### RFC Lifecycle

1. **Draft**: Initial RFC submission
2. **Review**: Community review and feedback
3. **Accepted**: RFC approved for implementation
4. **Implemented**: RFC has been implemented
5. **Deprecated**: RFC is no longer relevant

## Alternatives Considered

- **GitHub Issues**: Using GitHub issues for proposals
- **Design Documents**: Separate design document format
- **No Process**: Ad-hoc decision making

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Template Creation
- [ ] Create RFC template
- [ ] Document RFC process
- [ ] Set up RFC repository structure

### Phase 2: Process Implementation
- [ ] Implement RFC review process
- [ ] Set up RFC tracking
- [ ] Train team on RFC process

### Phase 3: Process Refinement
- [ ] Gather feedback on RFC process
- [ ] Refine template and process
- [ ] Document lessons learned

## Testing Strategy

- **Process Testing**: Validate RFC process with sample RFCs
- **Template Testing**: Ensure template covers all necessary sections
- **Review Testing**: Test RFC review process with team members

## Documentation

- **RFC Process**: Document RFC submission and review process
- **Template Usage**: Guide for using the RFC template
- **Best Practices**: RFC writing best practices
- **Examples**: Sample RFCs for reference

## Migration Guide

N/A - This is a template RFC.

## Open Questions

1. Should RFCs be required for all significant changes?
2. What is the appropriate scope for an RFC?
3. How should RFCs be prioritized?
4. What is the review timeline for RFCs?

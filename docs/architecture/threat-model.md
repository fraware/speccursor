# SpecCursor Threat Model

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive threat model for SpecCursor using the STRIDE methodology. The analysis identifies potential security threats, assesses their likelihood and impact, and provides specific mitigation strategies.

## Threat Model Methodology

We use the STRIDE framework to systematically identify threats:

- **S**poofing: Impersonating legitimate users or systems
- **T**ampering: Unauthorized modification of data or code
- **R**epudiation: Denying actions or events occurred
- **I**nformation Disclosure: Unauthorized access to sensitive data
- **D**enial of Service: Preventing legitimate use of the system
- **E**levation of Privilege: Gaining unauthorized access or capabilities

## Threat Assessment Matrix

| Spoofing               | Medium     | High     | High       | P1       |
| Tampering              | High       | Critical | Critical   | P0       |
| Repudiation            | Low        | Medium   | Medium     | P2       |
| Information Disclosure | High       | High     | High       | P1       |
| Denial of Service      | Medium     | Medium   | Medium     | P2       |

### Application Security Controls

#### Input Validation

```typescript
// Example: Webhook signature validation
function validateWebhookSignature(
  payload: string,
  signature: string,
  secret: string
): boolean {
  const expectedSignature = crypto
    .createHmac("sha256", secret)
    .update(payload)
    .digest("hex");

  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(
    Buffer.from(signature),
    Buffer.from(expectedSignature)
  );
}
```

#### Output Encoding

```typescript
// Example: Safe PR comment generation
function generateSafeComment(content: string): string {
  return content.replace(/[<>&'"]/g, (char) => {
    const entities: Record<string, string> = {
      "<": "&lt;",
      ">": "&gt;",
      "&": "&amp;",
      "'": "&#39;",
      '"': "&quot;",
    };
    return entities[char];
  });
}
```

### Infrastructure Security Controls

#### Container Security

```dockerfile
# Example: Secure container configuration
FROM node:18-alpine AS base
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs && \
    adduser -S nodejs -u 1001

USER nodejs
WORKDIR /app

# Read-only filesystem
VOLUME ["/tmp", "/var/cache"]
```

#### Secret Management

```typescript
// Example: AWS Secrets Manager integration
async function getSecret(secretName: string): Promise<string> {
  const client = new SecretsManagerClient({ region: "us-east-1" });
  const command = new GetSecretValueCommand({ SecretId: secretName });
  const response = await client.send(command);
  return response.SecretString || "";
}
```

  Action: "Require re-authentication, log event"

- Rule: "Container escape attempt"
  Condition: "Process spawned outside container namespace"
  Action: "Terminate container, alert security team"
```
